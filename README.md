# Source code to compute the mobility diversity, $H$


## Foreword

The present repository contains the source code used to compute the so-called _mobility diversity_, $H$, of travels made by travellers belonging to different socioeconomic groups (_i.e._, poor, middle, and rich) as well as of different gender (_i.e._, men, women, and all).
